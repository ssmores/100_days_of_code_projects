# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Free Code Camp's HTML5 and CSS portion of their Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was able to breeze through the first five hours (into 1ish hours), and half remembered how to do everything based on what I had learned previously.  Nothing is uploaded to GitHub, but it's a start.

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through Free Code Camp's Bootstrap portion of the Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts**: I was happy to get through yesterday's set of information quickly, and am hoping it's not as rusty coming back into it today. Also, I'm partially feeling better about <div> and <span>, but only partially.

### Day 3: Jan 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through jQuery exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I remember why I like jQuery (easy to write/use), even though I am still rusty on manipulating the DOM. 


### Day 4: Jan 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Made 2ish code pen pages...

**Thoughts** I started to make pages (as per FreeCodeCamp's FE cert path), but I'm not really feeling making webpages from scratch (on top of the fact that I have never really enjoyed doing that).
