The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Jan 1, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started with basics to ease me back into JavaScript (esp late at night).

### R1D2
Should start these earlier in the day... But was able to get through Bootstrap exercises!

### R1D3
jQuery is still my friend. 

### R1D4
There is not enough time or creative space to make a page that suits my whims.
